Check out my K.O.T.H Scripts for THM's King of the hill competitiions :)




## 1. Protect.sh bash Script...
Make sure to have a chattr binary all ready so that you can transfer it from your local machine to the remote machine...
Open a python server before running the scipt on the remote machine
```
python3 -m http.server IP 
```

Make sure to edit the bash protect.sh script to avoid any issues i.e add your ip and port & also the name of your chattr binary location...
The script is a bit dirty so before running it, make sure you have another shell opened up so that you still have access to the machine
